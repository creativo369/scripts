## Creativo Bash Script

If you constantly run the same set of commands at the command line, why not automate that?

For this reason, this small script was born with the purpose of speeding up the installations of useful programs and tools that every Linux debian ubuntu developer should have 

Here it is encapsulated in a script with command lines for the installation of tools and programs, saving me time in doing it one by one repeatedly to install the programs I need when creating a workspace.

#### ¿How to use? 

1. Open the terminal `ctrl + alt + t`
